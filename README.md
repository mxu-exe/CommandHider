# CommandHider

#### Hide your commands from players, as if they never existed

## Description

**CommandHider** is a powerful Paper plugin that lets server administrators fully control which commands players can see or use. With fine-grained permission-based filtering, commands can be hidden entirely — no suggestions, no tab-complete hints, and no “unknown command” messages. To restricted users, they simply don’t exist.

Perfect for survival, roleplay, or custom servers where clean UX and tight command security matter.

## Features

### 🧩 Permission-Based Command Hiding
Hide specific commands from players unless they have the correct bypass permission — no output, no trace, no clutter.

### 🔁 Group Inheritance System
Create clean, scalable access hierarchies with `inherit-groups`. VIPs can inherit from Admins, Defaults from VIPs, and so on.

### 🔒 Bypass Permissions Per Group
Fine-tune control by setting unique `bypass-permission` nodes for each group. Grant visibility where needed, and hide the rest.

### 🚫 True Command Suppression
Hidden commands won’t appear in tab-complete, can’t be executed, and return no "unknown command" default Minecraft message — as if they were never there.

### ⚙️ Lightweight, Declarative Config
Simple and readable YAML configuration allows quick setup and intuitive group management.

### 🛠 Designed for Performance & Stability
Built for Paper servers with efficiency and minimal overhead in mind — runs smoothly even on large servers.
